# Brute-Force-Example
So how do we actually go about hacking a login page?

There are two main types of attacks we can use here. Brute forcing and dictionary attacks. 

A brute force attack is where you try every possible password that exists. For example, we might start with A, then AA, then AAA, then AAB, and so on and so on until the correct password is found.

In theory, this will eventually find the correct password, no matter what it is. However, the time it takes can vary greatly. 

For example, finding a 5-character password with only lowercase letters could take seconds. A 16-character password with numbers, uppercase and special characters, however, could take millions of years!
